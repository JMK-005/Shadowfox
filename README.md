# 🦊 SHADOWFOX – Data Analytics Project

This repository contains three levels of data analytics tasks: **Beginner**, **Intermediate**, and **Advanced**.  
Each level includes practical exercises for data processing, visualization, and real-world dataset analysis using **Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Jupyter Notebook**.

---

## 🧠 Beginner Task – Summary
**Objective:** Learn and understand basic dataset exploration  
**Main Work Done**
- Imported dataset using Pandas
- Viewed dataset using `head()`, `tail()`, `shape`, and `columns`
- Checked data types and missing values
- Performed basic filtering and sorting operations
- Generated summary statistics using `describe()`

**Outcome:**  
✔ Gained basic understanding of dataset structure and information

---

## 📊 Intermediate Task – Summary
**Objective:** Identify patterns using data visualization  
**Main Work Done**
- Cleaned dataset and handled missing values
- Created multiple visualizations:
  - Bar Chart
  - Line Chart
  - Histogram
  - Pie Chart
- Used grouping and aggregation (`groupby`) for deeper insights

**Outcome:**  
✔ Observed distributions, category comparisons, and trend analysis

## 🎬 Advanced Task – Latest Movies Dataset Analysis (2025)
**Objective:** Complete end-to-end analysis answering a real-world question

### Research Question
👉 *How do release month and original language affect movie popularity and ratings, and is there a relationship between popularity and ratings?*

### Main Work Done
- Loaded and cleaned 2025 movie dataset
- Converted release dates & extracted `year` and `month`
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Generated visual insights including:
  - Popularity distribution
  - Ratings distribution
  - Popularity by month
  - Movies by language
  - Popularity vs rating correlation

### Findings / Outcome
- Most movies rated between **5 and 7**
- **July, September & October** are strong release months with higher popularity
- **English** is the most common and popular language
- **Weak correlation** between ratings and popularity  
  → a highly rated movie is not always the most popular

**Final Insight:**  
> Popularity highly depends on release timing and audience hype rather than ratings alone.
