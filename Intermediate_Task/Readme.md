# ⚡ Shadowfox (Intermediate Task) – README

## 📘 Overview
This project focuses on **intermediate-level data analysis and visualization** using Python libraries like **Pandas** and **Matplotlib**. The goal is to clean, process, and represent data in clear and meaningful ways through visual insights.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Perform **data analysis** using Pandas.
- Create **visual reports** using Matplotlib.  
- Identify trends, patterns, and insights from the dataset.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
- **Pandas:** For data handling and manipulation.  
- **Matplotlib:** For creating graphs and charts.  
- **NumPy (if used):** For numerical operations.  

---

## 📊 Key Steps
1. **Import Data:** Load the dataset into a DataFrame using Pandas.  
2. **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values, duplicates, and data types.  
3. **Analysis:** Explore columns and find patterns using descriptive stats.  
4. **Visualization:** Use Matplotlib to plot line, bar, scatter, or pie charts.  
5. **Conclusion:** Summarize findings based on visual output.

---

## 📈 Output
The result should include:  
- Cleaned and structured data.  
- Multiple plots showing insights (trends, comparisons, and summaries).  
- Observations written clearly after each visualization.

---

## 🏁 Conclusion
This intermediate task helps build practical data visualization skills.  
It bridges basic concepts to real-world data analysis, improving both coding logic and presentation of insights.
